Q1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?

When the number of hidden nodes increases from 1 to around 3–5, the accuracy improves significantly. For very small numbers (1 or 2), the accuracy is low because the model is too simple. After about 5 nodes, the accuracy does not improve much and may slightly decrease.

Q2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

With very few hidden nodes, the model underfits because it cannot capture complex patterns in the data. As the hidden nodes increase to a moderate number, the model’s capacity improves, leading to higher accuracy. However, adding too many hidden nodes can cause overfitting or redundancy, so the accuracy plateaus or slightly drops.
